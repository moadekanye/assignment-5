I start off with filtering the dataset to only include NBA regular season data. Then, I identify the player who has played the most regular seasons. After that, I calculate the player's 3-point shooting accuracy for each season by dividing 3-pointers made (3PM) by 3-pointers attempted (3PA). Next, I perform a linear regression to see how the player's 3-point accuracy has changed over the years and plot the trend. Finally, I use the regression line to calculate the average accuracy and compare it to the actual average, while also estimating missing seasons using interpolation.Then I calculate  basic statistics like the average, variance, skew, and kurtosis for Field Goals Made (FGM) and Field Goals Attempted (FGA) to see how they compare. After that, I run a paired t-test to check if there's a significant difference between FGM and FGA, since they're related. Then, I run separate t-tests on each one individually to see how they differ from a standard value (like 0).
